# fusion_storage_class (Resource)

A Storage Class (e.g. "Gold") is published by the AZ Admin. It is a coarse grained tier, perhaps just one per Storage Service and QoS. It specifies a Max IOPS / GB, bandwidth and size; as well as Storage Service.

## Example Usage

```terraform
// A storage service that uses only FlashArray//X
resource "fusion_storage_service" "storage_service_x" {
  name           = "storage-service-x"
  display_name   = "Storage X"
  hardware_types = ["flash-array-x"]
}

// A high performance storage class using X
resource "fusion_storage_class" "storage_class_performance" {
  name            = "storage-class-performance"
  display_name    = "performance"
  storage_service = fusion_storage_service.storage_service_x.name
  size_limit      = "1T"
  iops_limit      = 10000
  bandwidth_limit = "1G"
}

// A generic storage service
resource "fusion_storage_service" "storage_service_generic" {
  name           = "storage-service-generic"
  display_name   = "Storage Generic"
  hardware_types = ["flash-array-x", "flash-array-c"]
}

// A standard DB storage class using the generic storage service
resource "fusion_storage_class" "storage_class_db_standard" {
  name            = "storage-class-db-standard"
  display_name    = "DB standard"
  storage_service = fusion_storage_service.storage_service_generic.name
  size_limit      = "100T"
  iops_limit      = 5000
  bandwidth_limit = "250M"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The name of the Storage Class.
- `storage_service` (String) Storage Service in which the Storage Class is created.

### Optional

- `bandwidth_limit` (String) Maximum Bandwidth Limit of Storage Class.
			- The bandwidth limit in M or G units.
			M will set MB/s.
			G will set GB/s.
			- Must be between 1MB/s and 512GB/s.
			- If not provided at creation, this will default to 512GB/s.
- `display_name` (String) The human-readable name of the Storage Class. If not provided, defaults to I(name).
- `iops_limit` (String) Maximum IOPS limit of Storage Class.
			- The IOPs limit - use value or K or M.
			K will mean 1000.
			M will mean 1000000.
			- Must be between 100 and 100000000
			- If not provided at creation, this will default to 100M.
- `size_limit` (String) Maximum Volume size limit of Storage Class. 
			- Volume size limit in M, G, T or P units.
			- Must be between 1MB and 4PB.
			- If not provided at creation, this will default to 4PB.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
terraform import fusion_storage_class.storage_class_db_standard "/storage-services/storage-service-generic/storage-classes/storage-class-db-standard"
```
